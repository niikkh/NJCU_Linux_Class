Here you will find the homework assignment and supporting files for completing this assignment.

We read the first 17 pages of "The Awk Programming Language" in class. The only concept I showed you outside of those pages was how to
make a function - but I provided an example in one of the awk programs in this directory. You can read more about awk functions online if
you're curious.

The book is online free at the internet archive: https://ia802309.us.archive.org/25/items/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7/The_AWK_Programming_Language.pdf

The internet archive is a reliable source, but if you are paranoid about security like me you should read this in a browser on 
computer other than your every day computer i.e. a VM or an NJCU computer.
