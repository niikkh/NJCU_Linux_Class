## Recommended reading/viewing:

In general there is an overabundance of reading material on the internet about Linux/Unix and, as we discussed, you sometimes don't even need to go anywhere to learn - right there in your terminal you have `--help` and `man COMMAND` to get answers about different linux tools. 

For reading about BASH and Linux/Unix I recommend:
1. Evi Nemeth's "UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook (5th Edition)" - this is a very praised book about Linux system administration.
2. Christopher Negus - "Linux Bible" - another great book with lots of information about Linux.
3. Dave Taylor and Brandon Perry - "Wicked Cool Shell Scripts 2nd Ed" - a huge collection of cool bash programs with explanations of how they work. 
4. The pdf I've added in this repository called "unixbook....pdf"

For Information about awk/sed/grep I recommend:
1. Arnold Robbins & Dale Dougherty - sed & awk
2. Aho & Kernighan - The Awk Programming Language
3. The pdf I've added to this repo called "grep_awk_sed.pdf"

A good video about BASH:
1. Derek Banas "Shell Scripting Tutorial" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwrnmQumtPw

The standard recommended git book, available online for free:
1. ProGit - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

I've planned this class around the Linux Foundation System Admin Certification guidelines. This is a list of things you need to know to pass a Linux Foundation certification exam. The pdf is in this repository as well.

Also, we won't have time for it in this class, but there's a great tutorial online called "Beej's guide to network programming". If you like network programming in C, or plan to do it in the future, I love this tutorial, I learned a ton from it and hope we have time to take a peek at it this semester. http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/pdf/bgnet_A4.pdf
