Damn near every major enemy of all race types has some form of stomp. I did the reckoning last week and got a hydra boss with NO LEGS but they still felt the need to make it have a stomp like ability. What does making everything have a knockback do for gameplay besides infuriate players from dying to being knocked into a wall? Really wish they would tone this down and offer a bit more variety to majors.\n\nEDIT: I can see it coming already \u201cjust melee\u201d I as well as many others know how to avoid stomps. For example if you\u2019re playing the \u201csweatier version\u201d of gambit there will often times be so much going on that your can\u2019t focus on a melee to avoid a stomp. I understand how the mechanic works I just think it\u2019s very boring that nearly everything does it. I love swords but with the hit detection and the stomps, they are DOA.\n\nPotential Stomp replacement Ideas by race type:\n\nThese are all examples using the current range that a stomp would knockback the player. A Knockback is simply a mechanic that gets you off the boss. There are many things that can be done to force the player to retreat.\n\nVex/Hydra Bosses:\n\n1. An EMP black that Disables your weapons for a short period forcing you to retreat and reload your weapons.\n2. An ArkShock that leaves the player stunned Or puts you in floaty stasis like Cayde in various missions. It could last for a short period or be removed immediately if another player uses their ghost to release you.\n3. another form of EMP blast like the last encounter of scourge forcing players to move away from eachother to avoid taking additional damage\n4. An occasional Pillar of Ark energy blasts up from beneath the enemy that damages players within a shotgun/melee range\n\nScorn:\n\n1. A fire Aura that within a short range will burn the player, Or an ability to place a large circle of fire around the boss that blasts players for large amounts of damage if they dont retreat momentarily. ( Think Flame Shield from D&amp;D )\n2. A Solar Stomp that applies a Dot that quickly damages the player which requires you to be shot with Solar by another player to remove the dot. In turn giving you bonus damage if executed properly ( Fight fire with fire )\n3. Skreebs could run up to a boss and cling on only exploding if you get within a certain range of the boss doing massive damage to you whilst doing minor damage to the boss itself.\n\nCabal:\n\n1. Targeted Air strikes like we see in various public events which target a specific player requiring them to quickly find cover.\n2. A Personal Solar dome like we see in the Injection Rig events that covers the boss for a short period and makes him immune outside of it but if youre within you can do bonus damage whilst taking damage. It could be coupled with a ship in the sky that is providing the shield remotely that could be shot down to remove the buff if getting in melee range isnt possible.\n3. They could launch themselves in the air as they already do but while they are floating their jetpacks produce so much heat that it burns those within a certain range.\n4. Flashbangs that blind you for a short period forcing you to retreat\n\nTaken:\n\n1. Surrounding themselves with a Void Aura damaging players within melee/shotgun range\n2. a Void Eruption that covers those within a short range with void that damages them but turns them into a taken for a short period giving them taken abilities while draining hp quickly. if someone dies with the debuff it could spread to other allies that are within range and could be removed by being shot with void damage by another player.\n3. Teleporting someone into the taken realm for a short period where they must kill a certain percentage of enemies before they can escape. ( Ex kill a taken ogre that has relatively low HP)\n4. Putting you in a stasis or trapping you in a small dome that you cannot escape. It could be punctured by your teammates doing enough damage from the outside to free you. ( like the taken Vandals immunity shield only..you trapped)\n5. Blinding you ( like taken captains) for a short period forcing you to retreat or get killed while unable to see.\n\nFallen:\n\n1. Chain Ark energy blasts that leap from player to player doing massive damage the more people it hits.\n2. While invisible (or visible) they could 'sap' (Stun) one of your teammates for a short period almost like a taser of sorts. if you free your teammate you both gain temporary invisibility that lasts a short period but doesnt break upon doing damage\n3. Placing a large wall of Arc energy infront of them that makes them immune forcing you to change position to continue doing damage\n\nHive:\n\n1. A suppression field like what we already have ingame. higher damage and a larger decrease to speed the longer you remain within it.\n2. Placing you into one of those Purple crystal cocoons weve seen in various missions requiring a teammate to shoot it to free you or suffocate\n3. literally grabbing you and chocking you requiring your team to hit a specific crit spot to get you release or you choke to death\n4. Corrupting your weapons for a short period making you take a portion of the damage you deal.\n\nThese are just examples i came up with quick.

Damn near every major enemy of all race types has some form of stomp. I did the reckoning last week and got a hydra boss with NO LEGS but they still felt the need to make it have a stomp like ability. What does making everything have a knockback do for gameplay besides infuriate players from dying to being knocked into a wall? Really wish they would tone this down and offer a bit more variety to majors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I can see it coming already \u201cjust melee\u201d I as well as many others know how to avoid stomps. For example if you\u2019re playing the \u201csweatier version\u201d of gambit there will often times be so much going on that your can\u2019t focus on a melee to avoid a stomp. I understand how the mechanic works I just think it\u2019s very boring that nearly everything does it. I love swords but with the hit detection and the stomps, they are DOA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Potential Stomp replacement Ideas by race type:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all examples using the current range that a stomp would knockback the player. A Knockback is simply a mechanic that gets you off the boss. There are many things that can be done to force the player to retreat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vex/Hydra Bosses:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An EMP black that Disables your weapons for a short period forcing you to retreat and reload your weapons.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An ArkShock that leaves the player stunned Or puts you in floaty stasis like Cayde in various missions. It could last for a short period or be removed immediately if another player uses their ghost to release you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;another form of EMP blast like the last encounter of scourge forcing players to move away from eachother to avoid taking additional damage&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An occasional Pillar of Ark energy blasts up from beneath the enemy that damages players within a shotgun/melee range&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scorn:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A fire Aura that within a short range will burn the player, Or an ability to place a large circle of fire around the boss that blasts players for large amounts of damage if they dont retreat momentarily. ( Think Flame Shield from D&amp;amp;D )&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A Solar Stomp that applies a Dot that quickly damages the player which requires you to be shot with Solar by another player to remove the dot. In turn giving you bonus damage if executed properly ( Fight fire with fire )&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skreebs could run up to a boss and cling on only exploding if you get within a certain range of the boss doing massive damage to you whilst doing minor damage to the boss itself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cabal:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Targeted Air strikes like we see in various public events which target a specific player requiring them to quickly find cover.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A Personal Solar dome like we see in the Injection Rig events that covers the boss for a short period and makes him immune outside of it but if youre within you can do bonus damage whilst taking damage. It could be coupled with a ship in the sky that is providing the shield remotely that could be shot down to remove the buff if getting in melee range isnt possible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They could launch themselves in the air as they already do but while they are floating their jetpacks produce so much heat that it burns those within a certain range.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flashbangs that blind you for a short period forcing you to retreat&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taken:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Surrounding themselves with a Void Aura damaging players within melee/shotgun range&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a Void Eruption that covers those within a short range with void that damages them but turns them into a taken for a short period giving them taken abilities while draining hp quickly. if someone dies with the debuff it could spread to other allies that are within range and could be removed by being shot with void damage by another player.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Teleporting someone into the taken realm for a short period where they must kill a certain percentage of enemies before they can escape. ( Ex kill a taken ogre that has relatively low HP)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Putting you in a stasis or trapping you in a small dome that you cannot escape. It could be punctured by your teammates doing enough damage from the outside to free you. ( like the taken Vandals immunity shield only..you trapped)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Blinding you ( like taken captains) for a short period forcing you to retreat or get killed while unable to see.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fallen:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Chain Ark energy blasts that leap from player to player doing massive damage the more people it hits.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While invisible (or visible) they could &amp;#39;sap&amp;#39; (Stun) one of your teammates for a short period almost like a taser of sorts. if you free your teammate you both gain temporary invisibility that lasts a short period but doesnt break upon doing damage&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Placing a large wall of Arc energy infront of them that makes them immune forcing you to change position to continue doing damage&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hive:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A suppression field like what we already have ingame. higher damage and a larger decrease to speed the longer you remain within it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Placing you into one of those Purple crystal cocoons weve seen in various missions requiring a teammate to shoot it to free you or suffocate&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;literally grabbing you and chocking you requiring your team to hit a specific crit spot to get you release or you choke to death&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Corrupting your weapons for a short period making you take a portion of the damage you deal.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just examples i came up with quick. Some are better than others but they all do the same thing a stomp does while not being just a stomp. They get you to move back, they require you to do something to avoid the effect from hurting you or your team not just Melee to avoid a stomp. Stomps in some cases make sense but when its just a copy paste across all major enemy types it becomes extremely redundant and stale.

The fact that people from Bungie (even though not high positions there) are even replying and talking to us blows my fucking mind into the next ascendant realm. (Don't mind me Oryx, just passing by.) \n\nThey even comment on things outside of suggestions, feedback, community focus, etc; I think that's cool as hell. Yeah, maybe these updates, fixes, and patches are coming by really slow, at least we're getting them. I used to be a big time CoD fan, but the devs of that franchise hardly listen to player input anymore and just roll things out on a whim and be like, \"Oh, this new pay to win dlc gun will shut them up for now, etc.\" \n\nI understand that there are a lot of flaws (serious ones at that). Of course it blows my mind that someone from Bungie actually talks and replies to us, even if they're paid. So many franchises these days and they pretty much do whatever they want as developers (they have right to do so of course) but not listening to what their player base has to say at all seriously puts them in a arrogant position. Yeah, we can be the reason of a game's bad ideas like \"Nerf this and buff that, etc\", but a lot of ideas are really really good too and I can understand that people get really upset that they don't even get acknowledged.\n\nI think we take this game and its developers for granted sometimes. Try to be positive please, negativity does not achieve anything but to push them farther away from us. The amount of tolerance and patience these two guys have must rival Shaxx's love for Mara. \n\nThere is a difference between constructive criticism and being an asswipe because you can't control your anger/frustration.\n\nThank you for your time. \n\nEdit: I feel I must put this out there. This is my opinion, if others share it then so be it. I'm not trying police you guys/girls, I'm not blind to the ignorance on Bungie's decisions that make the game worse or implementing changes waaay over due after it's no longer relevant and no one cares about it anymore, I KNOW they're paid to interact with us. At least they do interact with us even if it can barely be called \"interacting\". I also understand there are other developers reaching out to their player base as well.

The fact that people from Bungie (even though not high positions there) are even replying and talking to us blows my fucking mind into the next ascendant realm. (Don&amp;#39;t mind me Oryx, just passing by.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They even comment on things outside of suggestions, feedback, community focus, etc; I think that&amp;#39;s cool as hell. Yeah, maybe these updates, fixes, and patches are coming by really slow, at least we&amp;#39;re getting them. I used to be a big time CoD fan, but the devs of that franchise hardly listen to player input anymore and just roll things out on a whim and be like, &amp;quot;Oh, this new pay to win dlc gun will shut them up for now, etc.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that there are a lot of flaws (serious ones at that). Of course it blows my mind that someone from Bungie actually talks and replies to us, even if they&amp;#39;re paid. So many franchises these days and they pretty much do whatever they want as developers (they have right to do so of course) but not listening to what their player base has to say at all seriously puts them in a arrogant position. Yeah, we can be the reason of a game&amp;#39;s bad ideas like &amp;quot;Nerf this and buff that, etc&amp;quot;, but a lot of ideas are really really good too and I can understand that people get really upset that they don&amp;#39;t even get acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think we take this game and its developers for granted sometimes. Try to be positive please, negativity does not achieve anything but to push them farther away from us. The amount of tolerance and patience these two guys have must rival Shaxx&amp;#39;s love for Mara. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between constructive criticism and being an asswipe because you can&amp;#39;t control your anger/frustration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I feel I must put this out there. This is my opinion, if others share it then so be it. I&amp;#39;m not trying police you guys/girls, I&amp;#39;m not blind to the ignorance on Bungie&amp;#39;s decisions that make the game worse or implementing changes waaay over due after it&amp;#39;s no longer relevant and no one cares about it anymore, I KNOW they&amp;#39;re paid to interact with us. At least they do interact with us even if it can barely be called &amp;quot;interacting&amp;quot;. I also understand there are other developers reaching out to their player base as well. It blows my mind because it&amp;#39;s hard for me personally to see game developer that are big companies even remotely talk with their players since they make so much money, why talk to us peasants when you really don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; to listen to us.

I'm not joking either. Here is a list of all the weapons that may as well not exist on console:\n\n- SMG's: Great on PC, struggle on console due to poor stability resulting in a lack of consistency. While there are a few exceptions, Recluse being a notable one, thats a pinnacle weapon. It does not make up for every other SMG. Aggressive frame SMG's (the ikelos smg/hard truths archetype) are flat out unuseable.\n\n- Auto Rifles, 600 and 720rpms in particular: While theres nothing wrong in the ttk department, their lack of stability means they aren't consistent enough to reliably shut down shotguns, which they must be able to do in order to be viable.\n\n- 150/140 hand cannons: I seriously think 150s are bugged. Their stats are amazing, especially their recoil direction, but even if we ignore bloom, they jump all over the place. This is especially noticeable on Thorn, with a recoil direction of 100, yet it still pulls to the right. Bloom is just nonsense.

I&amp;#39;m not joking either. Here is a list of all the weapons that may as well not exist on console:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMG&amp;#39;s: Great on PC, struggle on console due to poor stability resulting in a lack of consistency. While there are a few exceptions, Recluse being a notable one, thats a pinnacle weapon. It does not make up for every other SMG. Aggressive frame SMG&amp;#39;s (the ikelos smg/hard truths archetype) are flat out unuseable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auto Rifles, 600 and 720rpms in particular: While theres nothing wrong in the ttk department, their lack of stability means they aren&amp;#39;t consistent enough to reliably shut down shotguns, which they must be able to do in order to be viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;150/140 hand cannons: I seriously think 150s are bugged. Their stats are amazing, especially their recoil direction, but even if we ignore bloom, they jump all over the place. This is especially noticeable on Thorn, with a recoil direction of 100, yet it still pulls to the right. Bloom is just nonsense. Range falloff should be the thing keeping hand cannons in check instead. 140s suffer from all the problems of 150s, but to a lesser degree.
