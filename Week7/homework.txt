Homework:

1. Find and install a non-free software package on debian 9 by modifying your sources.list file. *Note*: non-free means
non-free. 0 credit for installing a contrib package. 0 credit for installing a main package. It must be a non-free package!!!

2. Install curl from source to /usr/local/bin. a) When you run curl on the command line by typing 'curl' which version of
curl is run? b) Why is that version of curl run and not the other?

3. Write an https request with curl to hit a the reddit rest API. If the version you compiled doesn't work, just use the one 
available by default. You may get an error response "too many request". 

Some references:

  Example curl request:
  curl -X GET -L https://www.reddit.com/r/TellMeAFact/top/.json?count=20

  What's a rest API? There is some good discussion o it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/40lfkn/eli5_rest_api/ . Or you can just google it. 

4. Write a hash algorithm that takes inputs and returns: 
  a. If the input is non-numeric: 0
  b. If the input is even: 1
  c. If the input is odd: 2
