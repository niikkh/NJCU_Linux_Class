A) When you run curl on the command line by typing 'curl' which version of curl is run? 
-> Version which installed on /usr/local/bin/curl will be running.
B) Why is that version of curl run and not the other? 
-> Since curl has been installed on /usr/local/bin/curl and which is the first path and once linux/unix finds the command in there
   it runs from it.
