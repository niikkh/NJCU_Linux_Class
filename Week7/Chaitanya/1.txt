I installed ALIEN ARENA is standalone 3D first person online death-match shooter crafted from the original source code of Quake II and Quake III
released by id software under the GPL license.


Added this to the source.list. 

  sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch main contrib non-free

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch-updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch-updates main contrib non-free

after adding those lines I used belowed commands. 
  apt-get update
  apt-get install alien-arena-data
  
To check if ALIEN ARENA IS THERE OR NOT.  
  dpkg -l | grep alien
