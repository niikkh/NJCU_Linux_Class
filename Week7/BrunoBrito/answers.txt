a)when you type "curl -V" you get:
curl 7.64.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.52.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2r zlib/1.2.8 libidn2/0.16 libpsl/0.17.0 (+libidn2/0.16) libssh2/1.7.0 nghttp2/1.18.1 librtmp/2.3

Features: AsynchDNS IDN IPv6 Largefile GSS-API Kerberos SPNEGO NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz TLS-SRP HTTP2 UnixSockets HTTPS-proxy PSL

And running "which curl" get:
/usr/local/bin/curl

b)looking at the PATH variable you get:
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games

This means that any packages installed at /usr/local/bin will be run instead of packages at /usr/bin, since the former appears first in the PATH and thus has precedence
