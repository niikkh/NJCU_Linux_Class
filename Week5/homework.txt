# Homework 5
## To Do:

1. Move the home directory to a new partition on a new disk. Update /etc/fstab if necessary to make permanent.

2. Add swap space to your machine. Update /etc/fstab if necessary to make you rswap space permanent.

3. Change the ssh message of the day of your machine to be three sentences explaining why someone would move their home
directory to a new partition, and a bit of text explaining what swap space is and why you would want it.

## Grading:
PR must be received by 7:00 PM on Thursday or won't be merged or graded.
50% for home directory moved. Must be on new partition with proper permissions.
40% for swap space.
10% for banner.

Configure a new vm to satisfy the above criteria. Log in to the machine via ssh and run the following commands:

```
$lsblk
$ls -l /home 
$free -h
$curl ipinfo.io/ip
$uptime
```

Then take a screenshot or a picture with your phone showing the ssh banner, and the output of the indicated commands. Pull request the picture in a directory called $yourName under Week5. Same as for week 4. 

Expectations:
banner should be visible
lsblk should show the home partition, maybe the swap space.
free should definitely show the swap space.
everyone's homework should be different, I'm verifying this via your ip address.
uptime should be less than 2 minutes. You have to reboot the machine to make sure that that your /home and swap space are
permanent.

See my sample submission in the Week5 directory.

Not sure how I can verify that it's you doing this homework and not someone else. Respect points if in your image you can convince me that its you! Like a pic of you or your school id or your dog or something in the image!
