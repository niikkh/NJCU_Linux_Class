( exam time from here: https://www.njcu.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2019-04/Spring_2019_Ugrd_Final_Exam_Schedule_03-28-19.pdf )

Set up a git server on a machine so I can clone some cool code from it.

Start with a VM from scratch, configure it as a git server using whatever notes you want. 

For credit I must be able to clone from it during class.

The cloned repo must contain a script that if run it with 

```
bash repo/script.sh
```

I get an ASCII image of a cat, like this:

```
$ bash repo/script.sh
 /\_/\
( o.o )
 > ^ <
```

Grading:
Pass/fail. 0/100.
