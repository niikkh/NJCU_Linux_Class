UTF8, Awk, Sed

Awk
####################################
1. Write an awk command to find the Russian name "Фёдор"  and output the word "Fyodor". 
   Your search pattern must use OCTAL notation for "Фёдор"
2. Write an awk command to find the Portuguese word "recordação" and output the word "memory". 
   Your search pattern must use HEXADECIMAL notation for the search pattern.
3. Write an awk command to find the Spanish word "niño" and output the word "boy".
   Your search pattern must use OCTAL notation for the search pattern.
4. Write an awk command to find between 3 and 5 crying laughing emojis and output "found ROFL!" for each matching line.
   Your search pattern must use HEXADECIMAL notation for the search pattern.
   
Sed
######################################
Repeat the above, but use sed instead of awk. For information about how to find octal / hex characters, read the man page

1. PR due April 18th 2019 by 7PM.
2. Include 2 files:
  i) awk_and_sed.sh - contains the 8 commands from the above problems.
  ii) sample_text.txt - contains a bunch of strings containing the indicated search patterns.
      Your awk_and_sed.sh script should search this file for the indicated patterns and output the indicated values.
      So, when I run your code I should see something like this:
      
      
      melvyn@thinkpad$ ./awk_and_sed
      Fyodor
      memory
      boy
      boy
      found ROFL!
      Fyodor
      memory
      found ROFL!
      found ROFL!
      boy
      
3. Ten points for each correct command ( a total of 80 points ) 10 points for the awk_and_sed script working and 10 points for
   sample_text.txt being correct.
