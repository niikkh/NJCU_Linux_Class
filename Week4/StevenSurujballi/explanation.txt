The rm command is dangerous because in Linux, there isn't a trash bin where you can recover files unlike in the Windows OS. Therefore, removing something with the rm command removes files and directories  permanently which is the main reason why it is very dangerous to use. Also, there isn't a warning when the command is used and so novice users may not immediately realize the damage that has been done.
